#Motivation

The project was inspired by the film moog, a documentary about Dr. Robert Moog, electronic instrument pioneer and inventor. Its goal is to convey an understanding of the inner workings of electronic synthesizers and their components. The reader is guided through the process of creating a small but functional modular synthesizer setup that is fun to play and experiment with. The intention was to investigate the possibilities and limits in designing and building an analog sound device for someone, who had not been in contact with analog synthesizers, let alone building electronics devices before.

#Chapter Overview

The first chapter represents the research on the historical background of analog synthesizers since the beginning of the twentieth century. It was tried to outline important milestones in the historic development from the first electronic sound generating devices until a point in time when manufacturers of modular synthesizers have developed a profitable market.

Subsequently the most important concepts of subtractive synthesis are summarized. A general overview over common sound generation and processing methods is given, whereby all concepts are applicable to both analog and digital synthesis. In chapter three these concepts are taken one step further and discussed in the context of electronic circuitry. Lastly the process of building an electronic synthesizer prototype is described.
