, a documentary about Dr.
 Robert Moog, electronic instrument pioneer and inventor.
 Its goal is to convey an understanding of the inner workings of electronic
 synthesizers and their components.
 The reader is guided through the process of creating a small but functional
 modular synthesizer setup that is fun to play and experiment with.
 The intention was to investigate the possibilities and limits in designing
 and building an analog sound device for someone, who had not been in contact
 with analog synthesizers, let alone building electronics devices before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Chapter Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first chapter represents the research on the historical background of
 analog synthesizers since the beginning of the twentieth century.
 It was tried to outline important milestones in the historic development
 from the first electronic sound generating devices until a point in time
 when manufacturers of modular synthesizers have developed a profitable
 market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequently the most important concepts of subtractive synthesis are summarized.
 A general overview over common sound generation and processing methods
 is given, whereby all concepts are applicable to both analog and digital
 synthesis.
 In chapter three these concepts are taken one step further and discussed
 in the context of electronic circuitry.
 Lastly the process of building an electronic synthesizer prototype is described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The process of building the prototype includes working with an oscilloscope
 to examine and verify the shape of various waveforms before and after modulatio
n.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To make it playable with a keyboard, a MIDI input module is added.
 It features an Arduino microprocessor to convert digital MIDI messages
 into control voltage outputs that other modules can connect to.
 It is the only digital component of the synthesizer, while tone generation
 and processing are analog.

A Personal Journey
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a trained programmer and web application developer the field of electronic
 engineering always seemed appealing to me.
 Hence the assignment for a research paper during the audio engineering
 course at SAE Institute seemed like a welcome opportunity to dive into
 the realm of building electronic devices in the context of sound generation
 and modification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of writing this paper has been an unexpectedly rewarding and
 inspiring experience, pushing the boundaries of my own musical and technical
 understanding.
 Most notably the concepts of free composition - meaning allowing randomness
 and therefore putting oneself in the position of reacting to a musical
 system, influencing it in terms of tendencies, rather than controlling
 it with a predetermed mindset - has been something that really changed
 my perseption of musical creativity.
 This for me seems much more attainable in the analog world, where electrical
 components and signal chains can be brought to their tipping points, resulting
 in an unpredictable outcome.
 That is where sound exploration begins, which is a totally different experience
 than knowing what will happen.
 Virtual digital environments, which I was familiar with on the other hand,
 generally seem to tend persuade the user to feel in control at all times.

 It was an electrical sound generator, that produced alternating sine wave
 shaped currents of different audio frequencies.
 A modified electrical dynamo was used in conjunction with several specially
 geared shafts and inductors to create the signals.
 The Dynamophone could be played with a polyphonic keyboard and featured
 special acoustic horns to convert the electrical vibrations into sound

In 1924 the russian inventor Leon Theremin created the Aetherophone, which
 would later be known as the Theremin.
 Unlike most electric instrument developed around that time, the Theremin
 had no keyboard.
 It was played merely by hand motion around two capacitive detecors, that
 generated electrical fields.
 These were affected by the electric capacity of the human body.
 One of these detectors was a vertical rod to control dynamics and the other
 a horizontal loop to change the pitch

The Givelet (1929) was a commercially more successful instrument, since
 it was designed as a cheap alternative to pipe organs.
 These instruments were polyphonic and unified the concepts of the Pianola
 - a self-playing piano, controlled by pre-punched tape - with electronic
 sound genaration.
 The ability to program electronic sounds should lead the way for future
 devices such as the RCA synthesizer or computer music production in general.
 However, the Givelet was about to take a back seat, when Laurens Hammond
 published his Hammond Organ in 1935.
 Its technical operation principle is reminiscent of the Dynamophone, since
 it also involved rotating discs in a magnetic field

The german engineer Harald Bode contributed to the design of several new
 instruments from the 1930's on, like the warbo formant organ (1937) or
 later the Melochord (1949).
 He was primarily interested in providing tools for a wide range of musicians,
 which is why his contributions straddled between the two major design tradition
s of new sounds versus imitation of traditional ones.
 He turned out to be one of central figures in the history of electronic
 music, since he was also one of the primary engineers in establishing the
 classic tape music studio in europe

The First Synthesizers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1955 the laboratories of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) introduced
 a new and very advanced machine to the public named the Olson-Belar Sound
 Synthesizer, later known as the RCA Mark I Music Synthesizer.
 It combined many means of tone generation and sound modification known
 at the time and is considered the first synthesizer.
 Mark I was built with the specific intention of imitating traditional instrumen
t sounds and to reduce the costs of the production of popular music by replacing
 musicians.
 However, the machine proved unsuitable for its original intent and was
 later used completely for electronic music experimentation and composition

 The synthesizer could not be played in the conventional sense in real time.
 Instead musical information had to be pre programmed as punched holes in
 a large paper tape.

Around the same time the outstanding guitarist and inventor Les Paul became
 famous with his multitrack guitar recordings.
 He stimulated many innovators not only with the success of his multitrack
 recorder, but also with his methods of electronic sound processing.
 Harald Bode was so impressed and inspired by his work, that he built a
 system consisting of a number of electronic modules for sound modification
 in late 1959 through 1960.
 His system featured ring modulator devices, envelope followers and generators,
 voltage-controlled amplifiers, filters, mixers and others

Acoustic events can generally be divided in two groups: noises and tones.
 Whereas tones - as opposed to noise - are classified as sound waves, that
 oscillate in a periodic manner.
 However this is only a theoretical classification, since most natural sounds
 are a combination of the two

\begin_layout Subsection
Wave Oscillation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the root of every artificial tone generating system there is an element
 that produces an oscillation.
 This element is mostly described as the oscillator, which represents the
 very source of what can be heard eventually.
 The oscillator produces a periodic wave, that moves between an amplitude-minima
 and -maxima.
 Its waveform (shape of the wave) determines the overtone structure and
 therefore the timbre of this basic source sound.
 Oscillators often provide several waveforms between which it is possible
 to switch back and forth.
 The pitch of the output signal is defined by the frequency of the wave
 and must oscillate between 20Hz and 20kHz in order for it to be audible
 to humans

\begin_layout Plain Layout

.
 The output signal can later be processed and modulated in several ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oscillators that swing at an infrasonic frequency - meaning a frequency
 so low, that it is not hearable anymore - are called low frequency oscillators
 (LFO).
 They are used to control parameters of different components of the synthesizer
 periodically.
 For example to influence the pitch of another oscillator to get a vibrato
 - or the amplitude to get a tremolo effect.
 Some oscillators frequencies range from very low to very high, in which
 case a distinction between oscillator and LFO is unnecessary.

 A true square wave has a 50 % duty cycle - equal high and low periods.
 However, oscillators often feature a pulse width parameter, trough which
 the high-low time ratio can be accessed.
 This has a distinct influence on the wave's timbre.
 In this case, the square becomes a pulse waveform.

Triggering Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use the previously discussed signal generators in a musical
 context, it is necessary to cut off their stationary signals when no note
 is being played.
 This is accomplished by routing the output signal of the generator to an
 amplifier and providing it with a gate signal.
 The source of the gate signal can be a keyboard or a sequencer, which would
 also send a pitch value to the oscillator to set its frequency

Dynamic Envelopes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important component responsible for shaping the dynamic structure
 of a note is the envelope.
 It is triggered by the the gate on/off signal and outputs a control signal
 that fades between the different state phases of a note.
 The rapidity of these changes is adjusted by parameters, that represent
 these states.
 Its output signal can be used to control an amplifier and therefore shape
 the dynamic structure of the note.
 The most common envelope type is the ADSR, which stands for attack, decay,
 sustain, release.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Attack sets how long the envelope signal rises after a note was triggered
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Decay sets how long it takes for the envelope signal to drop from its maximum
 to the sustain level after the attack phase was completed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

Sustain sets the output level for the time period after the decay phase
 and before the gate signal was terminated

 They remove a spectrum of frequencies from their input signal above or
 below the cutoff frequency and are often used in conjunction with an envelope
 or LFO modulation on the cutoff.
 This cutoff frequency is an important parameter determining the frequency
 at which the signal begins to be attenuated.
 The slew rate sets the slope of the filter - meaning how abrubt frequencies
 are being cut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Filters can generally be devided into two categories: Low pass and high
 pass filters (also called high cut and low cut).
 To get a bandpass filter, low- and high pass are connected in series.
 When connected parallely, they become a bandstop or bandreject filter.
 Lastly the allpass filter should be mentioned, which does not change the
 frequency spectrum but merely influences the phase of the signal around
 its cutoff

 A keyboard for example is a manual controller, since it is the movement
 of the players fingers which are translated into a voltage or control value
 and then used to control pitch and amplitude of a note.
 The same applies for rotary knobs and faders or touch sensitive surfaces.

The Modular Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A modular synthesizer is an electronic instrument, where sound generators,
 processors and control facilities are presented in separate independent
 entities called modules.
 These modules are not wired in a preconceived way, but connected together
 with patchchords.
 The second essential aspect is the concept of intermodular controllability,
 with which modules may modulate or regulate the behaviour of other modules.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is relatively easy to find circuits to construct simple oscillators and
 filters based on the fairly comprehensible concepts of resonant circuits
 and RC blocks.
 Some of these concepts will be covered later.
 However, as their flexibility and capabilities increase (e.g.
 controlling the frequency of an oscillator with 1 volt per octave), the
 circuits tend to get exceedingly complex, requiring solid expertise in
 electronics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why it was decided to switch to the usage of pre-designed, professionall
y manufactured circuit boards for this project as opposed to elaborating
 all the circuits on perf boards as originally intended.
 This made the goal of intermodular controllability attainable more easyily.
 The downside of this approach are higher costs for boards and parts.
 However, the quality of the end-product is impressing.
 Also the time saving using this strategy is not to be underestimated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the research phase of this project the author found out about a modular
 synthesizer building workshop taking place in berlin monthly.
 It is organized by a spanish collective from barcelona called 
\emph on
befaco
\emph default
 (http://befaco.org/).
 At the workshop it was possible to acquire various module kits containing
 all necessary parts and also receive tips and support while assembling
 them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the budget for this project was limited, it was tried to arrange a
 smaller setup that would still offer lots of sound design possibilities.

\begin_layout Section
Formats and Interfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several formats for module sizes, power supply plugs or patchchord
 connectors which emerged out of the production lines of various module
 manufacturers.
 For example Doepfer's modules are only compatible with their EuroRack cases,
 with a height of 128.5mm.
 These EuroRack modules use jack connectors for patching.
 A different size format often used in the DIY modular synth scene is the
 one the serge synthesizers use.
 They use banana jack connectors instead of mini jack for patching, which
 have the possibility of stacking banana connectors on top of each other
 and splitting the signal without having to use a multiplier module.
 For this project a combination was chosen: The modules are EuroRack size,
 but using banana plugs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For tuned modules it is important to consider whether they use a volts per
 octave or volts per hertz characteristic.

Building and Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get started with building electronic equipment, one has to obtain some
 tools first.
 This includes a soldering iron - best with adjustable temperature, a role
 of quality soldering tin, a desoldering pump and pliers for cutting and
 bending wire.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soldering is a process of mounting electronic parts onto a circuit board
 by heating up board and component and then melting the soldering tin into
 the joint.
 A good temperature for the soldering iron is between 300° and 350° celsius.
 The iron should not be pressed onto the joint for too long, because there
 is a risk of destroying the component if it is sensitive to heat.

Power Supply and Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the power unit a universal power supply circuit was chosen from an audio
 circuit technology book (Sontheimer, 2004, p.
 74) and mounted onto a perf board.
 Instead of the 7815 and 7915 voltage regulator ICs the 7812 and 7912 were
 used in order to get a ±12 volt power supply with a center tap for the
 ground.
 The modules can be connected to the four male 16-pin flat ribbon connectors,
 that were added to make the power supply compliant to the EuroRack standard.
 Another possibility would be to make a flying bus board by attaching those
 connectors to a flat ribbon cable that lies in the case.
 Or even just fix female connectors to the cable and plug them directly
 into the modules.
 Additionally it is planned to add an IEC socket and a power switch to it
 for more comfortable on and off switching and more steady starting current.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The case is a simple rack constructed from a few pieces of wood that are
 held together by 19 inch rails equipped with thread rails to fasten the
 modules.

The panels for all modules were made from pre-cut aluminum plates with a
 white varnish.
 The labels for knobs and banana sockets are printed on the plates with
 a method, that is similar to homemade circuit board etching.
 A mirror-inverted label template is printed onto a piece of high gloss
 paper for inkjet printers - but with a laser printer.
 It is cut and placed face down onto the upper side of the panel.
 By thoroughly pressing down a hot flat iron (for ironing clothes) onto
 the panel for a few minutes, the toner cartridge particles move to the
 panel.
 The paper residues need to be removed by placing the panel in some water
 and rubbing them off with a sponge.
 Afterwards the panel is sealed with transparent lacquer.
 Once the panel is dried, the holes for the knobs, switches, etc.
 can be prepunched and drilled.
 Lastly all borholes are deburred.

BF-22 Filter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module is an extended copy of the filter from the legendary Korg MS-20
 and is based upon the principle of the sallen and key filter.
 It combines two linkable filter stages in one module.
 Each stage features cutoff and frequency knobs, as well as several voltage
 control inputs for cutoff frequency and resonance, whereas the cutoff frequency
 input can be attenuated and inverted with one knob representing modulation
 depth (labeled: ×-1 ...
 0 ...
 ×1).
 The HP/LP switch determines, if the filter is used in high pass or low
 pass mode.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When turning resonance up, at one point the filter begins to self-resonate
 at the given cutoff frequency, which means that the filter can also be
 used as an oscillator.
 Therefore a volts per octave input for the cutoff control voltage was added,
 to be able to control the oscillating frequency in a musical context.
 A look at the oscilloscope shows a sine like waveform with few overtones.
 Turning the resonance to the maximum, the filter goes into distortion and
 the wave becomes more square causing the sound to get more rough.
 The amount of distortion is visually represented by a red LED.
